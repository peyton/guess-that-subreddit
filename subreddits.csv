A place to share photographs and pictures. Feel free to post your own, but please **read the rules first** (see below), and note that we are *not a catch-all* for general images (of screenshots, comics, etc.)

#Spoiler code#

Please mark spoilers like this:  
`[text here](/spoiler)`

Hover over to [read](/spoiler).

#Rules#

1. **No screenshots, or pictures with added or superimposed text.** *This includes [image macros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro), comics, infographics and most diagrams. Text (e.g. a URL) serving to credit the original author is exempt.*

1. **No nudity, porn or gore.** *Other NSFW content must be tagged.*

1. **No personal information.** *This includes anything hosted on Facebook's servers, as they can be traced to the original account holder. Stalking &amp; harassment will not be tolerated.* ***No missing-persons requests!***

1. **No post titles soliciting votes** *(e.g. ""upvote this"").*

1. **No DAE, ""[FIXED]"" or ""cake day"" posts, nor posts addressed to a specific redditor.** *""[FIXED]"" posts should be added as a comment to the original image.*

1. **Submissions must link directly to a specific image file or to a website with minimal ads.** *We do not allow blog hosting of images (""blogspam""), but links to albums on image hosting websites are okay. URL shorteners are prohibited.*

1. **No animated images.** *Please submit them to /r/gif, /r/gifs, or /r/reactiongifs instead.*

* If your submission appears to be filtered but **definitely** meets the above rules, [please send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23pics) with a link to the **comments section** of your post (not a direct link to the image). **Don't delete it**  as that just makes the filter hate you! 

* If you come across any rule violations,  please report the submission or  [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23pics) and one of us will remove it!

* Please note: serial reposters may be filtered

Please also try to come up with **original post titles**. Submissions that use certain clichés/memes will be automatically tagged with a warning.

--
A subreddit for anything related to games (but not [sports](http://www.reddit.com/r/sports)).

""Related"" means that **posts must contain gaming-related content in the link/post body, not just a ""forced"" connection via the title or a caption added to the content.**

[reddit Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/reddit)

# Community Rules

1. **Submissions must be directly gaming-related.** [Memes are allowed as long as both the image and the text are gaming related.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gnlvh/mod_post_clarification_on_rule_1/) Something that ""reminds you of a game"", or ""looks like something from a game"" is not an allowable submission; similarly, reaction GIFs are not allowed as submissions.

1. Following [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) is encouraged.  Following the [Rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) is required.

1. No general URL shorteners (bitly, tinyurl, etc). Single-site URL shorteners (such as youtu.be or fav.me) are allowed.

1. No product requests or giveaways, including game keys.  Enabling or attempting to enable piracy [will result in a ban](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/m1pry/a_friendly_reminder_to_rgaming_talking_about/).

1. NSFW submissions and comments must be labeled as such.

1. Spoilers must be posted using the following formatting:  
`[X Kills Y](/spoiler)`  
Result: [X Kills Y](/spoiler).  
To mark a spoiler as relevant to a specific game/topic, use the alternate formatting:  
`[Player 1 wins](/spoiler ""Pong"")`  
Result:  
[Player 1 wins](/spoiler ""Pong"")  
*Report posts containing spoilers not using the above method*

1. Submit the source of the content. No hotlinked or re-hosted comics (unless the author specifically allows it). Submit the page on the author's site containing the comic.

1. No personal websites or YouTube channels.  No referral or affiliate links.

1. No Kickstarter, Steam Greenlight, et al. ""reminder"" posts. Submissions about new projects or major updates to existing ones are allowed.

1. Posts and comments, whether in jest or with malice, that consist of racist, sexist, or homophobic content, will be removed, regardless of popularity or relevance.

#Important Notes

If your submission does not immediately appear in the link listing, **do not delete it.** Wait 5 minutes to give AutoModerator a chance to look at it; it approves most submissions automatically. If it hasn't shown up *after more than 5 minutes*, simply [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23gaming) and ask us to let it through.

The moderators of /r/gaming reserve the right to remove any ""bandwagon"" posts. This includes ""No, THIS is the best ___"", ""FIXED"", ""I see your ___ and raise you ____"" and other types of reply posts. If you feel like you have a response to an existing post, reply in the comments section to avoid having your post removed.

---

Please post news items only, with the exception of meta posts about /r/news itself. Self-posts aggregating news data and ""independent reporting"" each count as news, but are not an excuse to editorialize.

Your post will likely be removed if it: 

- is not news (or a meta post).
- is an opinion/analysis or advocacy piece.
- primarily concerns politics.
- has a title not taken from the article.
- has a pay wall or steals content.
- covers an already-submitted story.
- violates [reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/).

Your comment will likely be removed if it:

- is racist, sexist, vitriolic, or overly crude.
- is unnecessarily rude or provocative.
- is a cheap and distracting joke or meme.
- is responding to spam.
- violates [reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/).

Extreme or repeat offenders will be banned.

#Posting rules#
 
1. Submissions must be verifiable*. Please link directly to a reliable source that supports the claim in your post title.* Images alone do not count as valid references. *Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).*
 
1. No personal opinions, *anecdotes or subjective statements (e.g ""TIL xyz is a great movie"").*

1. No news or recent sources. *News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) more recent than two months are not allowed.*
 
1. Nothing related to recent politics.
 
1. No misleading claims*. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.*
 
1. *Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:*
   1. *Titles must begin with ""TIL ...""*
   1. *Make them descriptive, concise and specific (e.g.* not *""TIL something interesting about bacon"").*
   1. *Titles* must be able to stand on their own *without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.*
   1. *""TIL about ..."" and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word ""about"").*
   1. *""TIL how to ..."" posts belong on* **/r/HowTo.**
1. *No trivial or obvious facts (e.g. ""TIL the sky is blue""), or facts that appeal only to a narrow audience, specifically* no software/website tips *(e.g. ""TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22"").*
1.  All NSFW links must be tagged *(including comments).*

Please [spay and neuter](http://www.petsmartcharities.org/spay-neuter/locator/) your animals!

####Guidelines

[](/r/Music/wiki) 

[/r/Music Posting Rules](/r/Music/wiki/index#wiki_submission_rules)

1. **No Images**    
    Instead post to [one of these subreddits](/r/MusicPics+AlbumArtPorn+InstrumentPorn+BandPorn+MetalMemes+LookWhoIMet+Pics+concertporn).    

2.  **Fridays are Self-Post only**    
    Self-Posts that only contain a link will be removed. Friday is for interesting discussions, not YouTube links.    

3. **\/r/Music is not American Idol**    
    Do not post your own music with titles that try and gain upvotes through sympathy. Your music should stand on its own. If you have an interesting story behind the music, you can add this in comments or self-post text.

    **Good Example**: ""*This is a song I made*""    
    **Bad Example**: ""*I am homeless and recorded this song with my last nickels*""    
    **Good Example**: ""*Here is a song I made for a charity*""    
    **Bad Example**: ""*Please upvote this song I made for starving orphans*""

* Made a tune? Have a band? See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/lsey3/find_subreddits_for_redditormade_music_promote/) before posting.

**E is for explain.** This is for concepts you'd like to understand better; **not** for simple one word answers, walkthroughs, or personal problems.

**LI5 means friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations**, not responses aimed at literal five year olds (which can be patronizing).

----

* **Search before submitting** with keywords from your topic. The search box is in the upper right corner of the subreddit.

* Please be neutral in your explanations, and note your personal bias in controversial topics.

* No low effort explanations or single sentence replies. 

* **Don't** post loaded questions just to argue your point of view.  

* After receiving an adequate explanation, OP should mark the post [ ](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive#check) **Explained**. Explained posts are still open to discussion!

* ELI5 isn't a guessing game; if you aren't confident in your explanation, please don't speculate.

# Rules
*hover for details*

|||
|:------|:---|
|No non-ragecomics allowed|If you aren't telling a story, there are no characters, action, or similar, then its not a rage comic. This includes comics ending in [AdviceAnimals](/r/adviceanimals)|
|No comparison comics|These are comics that compare one thing to another. If you're making any comparison in your comic, chances are you're doing it wrong|
|No reposting|This subreddit is for original content only, meaning comics YOU made. Don't post stuff you found from elsewhere on the web, it's probably been here already. And don't resubmit your comic because it did poorly. Reposting will result in a ban|
|Upvotes don't matter|It doesn't matter if your comic has 1.21 Gigavotes, we can and will remove it if it violates any of the rules|
|No meta-posts|Don't make a comic complaining about another user, comic, or the moderators. Additionally, don't make comics to *“introduce”* a new rageface|
|NSFW tags are free|Please use NSFW tags for anything that might have the remote possibility of getting someone fired or in trouble|
|Comics must be between 2 and 8 panels|Your comic must be between 2 and 8 panels long. We don't want single panels, nor do we want novels. No comics made of double-width panels only|
|No blogposts|Blogposts are preachy, self-serving, boring comics. These often take the form of a full-panel stare face lecturing someone, posts about how your dog/cat/grandpa died, and similar. Your post must be *relatable*, not a personal anecdote|
|No vote-begging|Do not mention cakedays, karma, upvotes, or anything similar|
|Be light on text|People come here for quick, simple humor. If you find your comic heavy on words, try submitting it to /r/ragenovels. This includes labeling ”poorly drawn televisions” and similar|
|No non-images|If your comic is from some site other than imgur or minus, then its not permitted, and **will** be removed as spam|
|No dead horse beating|Avoid tropes of rage comics, including, but not limited to `le`, `das`, `moi`, `true story`, `[FIRST]`, `Extra Panel`, `Made for reddit`, and `[FIXED]`|
|Mods have the final say|If a comic is removed by a moderator, even if it doesn't seem to violate any of the other rules, it remains removed|


----

# FAQ
*hover for details*

|||
|-|-|
|Why isn't my comic on the ""new"" tab?|Give it a second. It was probably caught by the evil robotic spam filter, but we've created an even more powerful robot to save everything from the filter; it just can take a couple minutes. If it still doesn't work, it was probably removed for breaking a rule (read them!).|
|Can I be a moderator, too?|As much as we love when community members want to help out, we can't accept requests for becoming moderators, or we'd be overwhelmed with nothing but such requests. Therefore, requesting to be a moderator will actually result in you getting banned instead. When we feel we need more moderators, we recruit from a list of people we have identified as being helpful and positive role models for the community. If you want to be a mod one day, that's how you'll go about doing it|
|How do I get flair?|If you ask for flair, we will **never** give it to you, no matter how many blowjobs you offer|

*****

/r/cats is a positive place, remember to **click the report button on negative comments and submissions**, it helps the moderators catch things faster!

Please note that currently **there are no rules against reposts or RIP posts.**

[Flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/17l6ws/mod_announcement_user_flair_trial/) is enabled on this subreddit, why not use it to tell us about your cat? See moderators' flair for examples.

The moderators of this subreddit are not responsible for any medical advice given and we suggest that you don't post it. Go see a vet!

*****

**Rules**

* **No NSFW content.**

* Posts must feature a cat that is alive and safe at the time the photo was taken or during the video. Comics about/featuring cats are an exception to this rule, along with articles which must be positive about cats.

* No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. ""This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww"", ""it's my cake day"", ""my first post here"", ""any love for ..."").

* Links asking for funding or competition votes will be removed (see the list of subreddits below for a possible alternative).

* **No slurs, creepy comments or harassment of any kind. Also comments should be about cats, not people.** If someone is harassing, do not respond with similar words, *all* comments containing slurs will be removed, instead, please report offending comments to the moderators with the report button. We will also remove breeding 'witch hunts'; inform neutrally as the submitter may be a rescue fosterer! Do not link to pornographic or beauty subreddits, or shower submitters with compliments, while this isn't negative, we don't want submitters to feel creeped upon. Do not post personal information at all, this includes Facebook links.

Some of these rules are based upon [Reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), [Reddit's TOS](http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

#Rules:

* **Any and all personal info must be 100% blacked out**. This includes but is not limited to: usernames, page names, faces, **profile pictures**, location data of any kind, and first and/or last names. Failure to do so in a submission or a comment will result in a removal.
 
* Do not post direct links to profiles, threads, or off-site material containing personal info. You will be banned and reported to the admins for this infraction.
 
* **Do not ask for personal information of any kind nor for links to the facepalm sources.**
 
* When removing personal information, completely cover them with opaque/solid color. Do not blur, ""pixelate"", or partially cover them.
 
* **Witch hunts will not be tolerated.**
 
* Racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise abusive content will be removed and the commenter/poster may be banned. Please be civil, and **use [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) as a guideline.**
 
* The mods reserve the right to remove posts subjectively deemed ""not a facepalm."" For example, obvious jokes and sarcasm are not facepalms.
 
* **Do not post misused memes or posts asking for likes/shares/comments  -- also known as ""like/share/comment whoring""**
 
* Do not post overused facepalms like ""l33t speak"", ""excessive slang usage"", ""internet speak"", ""my phone stopped working -- *sent from my mobile device*"", nor the alike;
 
* **Grammar/spelling errors are not facepalms.** Do not make posts centered on grammar/spelling errors. (But if a grammar/spelling error leads to a facepalm-y situation/pun, you may post them.)
 
* No posts featuring age. We get it. Kids are naive, elders have trouble with computers; it got old after the first thousand times of hearing about it, and bullying kids and elders is *never* acceptable here.
 
**Things that *will* get you banned:**

* Spamming
* Doxxing of any kind
* Racial Slurs
* In some cases, user abuse
* Breaking the rules stated above
* Giving out any personal information

**If you do get banned:**

* Send a *polite* modmail asking for specifics about your ban. It might be temporary, in which case you should take it as a learning experience and review our rules.

Cosplayers and fans, amateur and professional: welcome.

#Behavior

* **Treat each other with respect**, all of the other people you're interacting with have roughly the same amount of feelings that you do.  Many cosplayers put huge amounts of time and effort into their work and are not doing it to please you, specifically. Constructive criticism when desired is a good thing.  

* **Personal attacks, name-calling, degrading and/or shaming speech are not welcome** and can (and probably will) result in an **instant, permanent ban**.  People do not come here to be hit on or told that they have turned you on. We don't want to hear about how you feel when someone's body, presentation, or gender doesn't suit your specific desires. 

* **Comments showing blatant sexism and objectification of cosplayers will be removed *and* posters will be banned without warning.**

Please report comments that don't follow these guidelines. It's the fastest way to get moderator attention. Thank you!

##To use an emoticon, enter \[\](/xyz)

##x for the letter at the top-left cell of a chart, y for the column and z for the row of the emoticon. [Full guide here](//redd.it/qxhwe).

##Alternatively, you can use the name. For example, `[](/scootacheer)`.

##There's text often hidden in the ponymoticons! Roll over them with your mouse to reveal.

*  Questions, such as ""Where else could he be?"" are not permitted.

II. **Titles**

#Commenting

**Please report rule-breaking comments**

Junk comments distract from this subreddit a lot more than in other subreddits that are not based on original content. 

Comments that are cliche, text-only, not an original work, memes, reaction gifs, or off topic are *subject to removal by the moderators without notification.*

Top-level comments must contain an original photoshop.

---
[](/emptyspace)
#Voting  

Please upvote based on quality of work. **Lazy** shops shouldn't win just because they made you laugh. 

Please do not downvote *submissions* just because they do not have obvious potential. 

---
[](/emptyspace)
Please [report](http://i.imgur.com/DYBtk.png) inappropriate content to the mods, and send us [a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphotoshopbattles) letting us know why it was reported.

1201282272.0	"Jokes and any other funny things.

**/r/Jokes does not give karma for submissions. Comment karma still works**

Note: If you are offended by a joke, you have two options:

* You can man up and understand this is a subreddit dedicated to jokes, OR

* You can go to /r/shitredditsays and whine like the baby you are. Or the newly created /r/cleanjokes.

If you want to be even MORE offended, try out /r/MeanJokes, the love child of /r/Jokes and /r/Imgoingtohellforthis.

We aren't here to hold your hand, and censor you from anything offensive. If you want someone to do that, walk out of the basement and ask your mommy to install a net nanny.

These are jokes. Some of them are old, and as such reflect the tone of the times. Some of them are new, and just as offensive. We don't care. Unless it's spam, it stays.

While this rule has been in place for the last 2 years, I feel I need to actually write it down. We do not support outside sites at all, much less for money. We also do not accept submissions where you advertise your own site, even with a joke. Sites you do not have a financial interest in are okay. While it's hard to enforce this rule, mods will use their discretion.

**POLANDBALL IS OF REDDIT**

Wiggly mouse-drawn comics where balls represent different countries. They poke fun at national stereotypes and the ""international drama"" of their diplomatic relations. Polandball combines history, geography, Engrish, and an inferiority complex. The comic series first became popular on a well known German image board int ze internetz.

Polandball is unique and it should remain so. It's clearly distinguished from rage comics and memes.  Read the [**Official Polandball Tutorial**](http://i.imgur.com/W9vVvKZ.png#red-text). To keep the quality of the content high, all comics have to comply to it.

**Why can't I submit comics?**

**HONOUR TO WHOM HONOUR IS OF**

[berndmade](#berndmade) this comic was made by someone who most probably goes by the nick bernd *somewhere else*  int  ze  internetz.

[redditormade](#redditormade)  if you made a comic yourself  you can click on *flair* in the post and apply this label. It looks weird first but that's fixed with a  page reload.

[Hussar Wings](/r/polandball/wiki/index/honours/hussar_wings#hussar) only a select company of  
Honorary Polish Winged Hussars is allowed to bear this sign of splendour. Visit their [Hall Of Fame](/r/polandball/wiki/index/honours/hussar_wings).

#About

You found a Tumblr post about how a brave transgendered feminist WoC made a white male cishet check his privilege? I still get aroused every time I think about how that happened in real life.

Your Facebook newsfeed tells a tale of how a newly enlightened 15-year-old Atheist put that stupid fundie in their place? My girlfriend who you haven't met because she goes to a different school totally saw it happen and verified it for me.

You read a rage comic describing how a man totally made a woman orgasm by song alone? I can confirm this; I used to sleep with that woman before the man's audible vibrator took her away.

Post all of these stories and more here, a place where we collect and verify the truest stories on Reddit.

Some basic rules apply, give them a read before posting a 100% true story or commenting on one.


#Rules

Hover over each item for details

|||
|:------|:-----|
|**1. No posting any personal information.**| Finding someone's personal information like a real name, a facebook account, twitter, etc, and posting it in the comments is grounds for a ban from the entire website. The only exceptions to this rule are major public figures and those actively attempting to be public figures. If you're not sure whether they would want publicity, do not post it. |
| **2. For direct reddit posts, please replace ""www"" with ""np."" If you take a screenshot, please blur usernames!** | If you fail to do either/or, your post may be removed. |
| **3. No bullying of any kind.** | Do not harass anyone you find here or encourage others to harass them. Do not be nasty to your fellow users. Any bullying on /r/thatHappened or ""in the name of"" /r/thatHappened is grounds for an automatic banning.|
| **4. Make an effort with your title!**| Titles **MUST** describe the event, be written like a newpaper headline, and should make the reader say ""Yep. That happened."" [This thread goes into greater detail as to what an appropriate title consists of.](http://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/comments/1ir4cx/metatitle_guide/) Any post with a title consisting solely of 'Can confirm, am ________' will be removed.|
|**5. All submissions must be a link to a** ***story!***| This subreddit is for utterly plausible and believable tales told in a manner that is 100% not twisted, exaggerated, or self-aggrandizing. If what you're linking is just a sentence or two, it likely doesn't fit here. |
|**6. Remember the NSFW tag if the post isn't safe for work.**| The button can be found within the ""comment, save, share, hide"" group.|
|**7. No crossposts from /r/4chan or any of the Cringe subreddits, and no reposts from /r/ThatHappened.** | [This is an example of what IS NOT allowed.](http://i.imgur.com/2wjPpq9.jpg)|
|**8. No Advice Animals or other similar memes.**| Seriously, reposts suck and they don't belong here.|
|**9. No macro images UNLESS they tell a tale.** |  [This is an example of what IS NOT allowed.](http://i.imgur.com/W2lIDZ4.jpg)|
|**10. No ""liek dis if u cri evrytim""-esque chain letters, emails, and so on.** |[This an example of what IS NOT allowed.](http://i.imgur.com/IqKZYaf.jpg)|
|**11. No creating your own event and pushing it off as an event that actually happened. We find out, you get banned.** |  We can't have made-up things sullying a subreddit dedicated to only true stories that are 100% true and actually happened. [This is an example of what IS NOT allowed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/comments/1caqgh/just_got_back_from_the_verification_offices_this/)|
|**12. The following are NOT allowed to be posted on this subreddit, for they are impossible for the mod team to verify their truthfulness:**| Any ""dad jokes"" or ""forwards from grandma,"" any ~~fake~~ super real texts, any poems and short stories that are intended to be fiction, and obvious jokes. This list *is* subject to change from time to time, however. Any changes will be stickied.|

1201219852.0	"* **About \/r/comics**
    &gt; This reddit is for everything related to comics and webcomics.  Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on print comics are welcome.    
    &gt; &amp;nbsp;             
    &gt; Comic artists are welcome to post their own work in whatever format or at whatever host they want.  
    &gt; &amp;nbsp;             
    &gt; **NEW RULE: Artists without Artist Flair who use a rehosting site like Imgur must include [OC] in the post title.  That means ""Original Content"" and makes it clear you made the comic.**      
    &gt; &amp;nbsp;         
    &gt; If you are posting something you did not make, you need to link to an original source, like the artist's website.  Link to the page, not the image file, so the artist gets the credit and site traffic.

* **How to get Artist Flair**
    &gt; Do you draw a webcomic? [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  The easiest way to provide proof is to post something on your comic's website that references your Reddit account.

* **How to make the Mods go Hulk Smash**
    1. Hotlink or rehost comic you didn't make
    2. Fail to link to original or cite source
    3. Link to image instead of source website
    4. Post the punchline in title
    5. Fail to tag NSFW when needed
    6. Lament about unfunniness of a post
    7. Change the watermark on a comic you didn't make 
    8. Use URL shortening/hijacking tool (wp.me, bit.ly, su.pr, etc.)


* **How to find Original Sources**
    1. [Google Search by Image](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html)
    2. [Tineye Reverse Image Search](http://www.tineye.com/)
    1. [OhNoRobot Webcomic Search](http://www.ohnorobot.com/)

* **Content that is not welcome here**
    1. Rage comics (post in [/r/f7u12](/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu) or /r/ragecomics)
    2. CAPTCHA comics (post in /r/captchaart)

**How to find juicy social justice warriors on Tumblr:**

Browse SJW tags! When taking material from a tag to post here, either screenshot it or link to the blog post, do not simply link to the tag page. To link to the blog post from a tag page, click the folded paper graphic at the top right corner of the post and copy that URL here.

Tags to watch include...

* [Social justice](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/social-justice)

* [Privilege](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/privilege)

* [Feminism](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/feminism)

* [MRA](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/mra)

* [Masculism](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/masculism)

* [Buttereggs](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/buttereggs)

* [Oddnose](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/oddnose)

...But feel free to check others and simply follow any good blogs you know of for content.

***

**Rules:**

1) Don't be massive twat. **We're here to make fun of Tumblr SJAs, but we're not here to outright troll them or personally attack them.** You can joke about them and write negative comments about them, but **don't send hate messages to their blogs or communicate with the bloggers in any way** or insult their personal family lives or whatever. I'd also really rather you didn't make fun of people with genuine problems like cancer or depression, but feel free to make fun of anyone who's self-diagnosed with something and is clearly bullshitting. You know where the line is.

2) **Don't post personal information here.** Personal information includes full names and locations of bloggers. I don't care whether or not it's in the blog, don't copy it here. You will be banned.

3) If you're linking to a blog containing NSFW material, mark it as NSFW.

4) Non-Tumblr content: Links to other blogging sites with the same type of social justice content are allowed but **do not post anything overly political or too serious.** If you post Facebook screenshots make sure you censor all personal information (refer to rule 2).

5) **Satire posts should go to /r/TumblrCirclejerk!**

6) Have a funny Tumblr blog post or screenshot that *isn't* related to social justice? Post it to /r/loltumblr.

7) No Gawker links! If you want to post stupid Gawker shit, post a screenshot so the fuckers don't get any ad revenue from us.

8) **THIS IS NOT A META SUB.**

9) Have fun at all times!

###What makes a good FPS?
* Fuck just read a few, you'll pick up on what's good and what isn't pretty fast. 
* It's all not always fun and games, be prepared to experience all spectrums of rage, lols, and feels. And expect to be permanently forever grossed out.
* This sub is a place for you to tell us about hamplanets in your life and your relationships/encounters with them. Remember that hamplanet is not *just* about the weight, but also the hamentality - rudeness, entitlement, fatlogic, etc. Not all fat people are hambeasts but all hambeasts are fat people. 
* Please adhere to [Reddiquette](http://en.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) along with our community rules, which can be found at the top of the sidebar.
